# Table of contents

Baserow is an open-source online database tool. Users can use this no-code platform to create a database without any technical experience. It lowers the barriers to app creation so that anyone who can work with a spreadsheet can also create a database. The interface looks a lot like a spreadsheet. Our goal is to provide a perfect and fast user experience while keeping it easy for developers to write plugins and maintain the codebase. The developer documentation contains several topics you might need as a developer.

## Accessing web dashboard

Open up the dashboard on http://localhost:8080/

You will be presented with the Sign-in screen. If you are on a freshly created instance, then you need to create a user first.

### First user

Use the dashboard to sign-up as the first user or call the sign-up API manually to create the first user. Users must create a password with at least 8 characters.


API CALL

As you will see later in [actions](/actions/actions.md) sign up and sign in api's are nothing special but just actions defined on certain tables.

Request 

```bash
curl 'http://localhost/action/user_account/signup' 
--data '{"attributes":{"name":"name","email":"email@domain.com","password":"password123","passwordConfirm":"password123"}}'
```

Response

```json
[{
	"ResponseType": "client.notify",
	"Attributes": {
		"message": "Created user_account",
		"title": "Success",
		"type": "success"
	}
}, {
	"ResponseType": "client.notify",
	"Attributes": {
		"message": "Created usergroup",
		"title": "Success",
		"type": "success"
	}
}, {
	"ResponseType": "client.notify",
	"Attributes": {
		"message": "Created user_account_user_account_id_has_usergroup_usergroup_id",
		"title": "Success",
		"type": "success"
	}
}, {
	"ResponseType": "client.notify",
	"Attributes": {
		"__type": "client.notify",
		"message": "Sign-up successful. Redirecting to sign in",
		"title": "Success",
		"type": "success"
	}
}, {
	"ResponseType": "client.redirect",
	"Attributes": {
		"__type": "client.redirect",
		"delay": 2000,
		"location": "/auth/signin",
		"window": "self"
	}
}]
```

Nothing important in the response of signup to keep track of. 

Successful response means now we can login as a user and become the administrator.

A failure response would look like this:

```json
[{
	"ResponseType": "client.notify",
	"Attributes": {
		"message": "Failed to create user_account. Error 1062: Duplicate entry 'email@domain.com' for key 'i79f4e12e72442d30f2b99a84fce3c392'",
		"title": "Failed",
		"type": "error"
	}
}]
```

Or 

```json
[{
	"ResponseType": "client.notify",
	"Attributes": {
		"message": "http error (400) email and 0 more errors, invalid value for email",
		"title": "failed",
		"type": "error"
	}
}]
```

The token is to be used in the Authorization header of for all HTTP calls to identify the user.

First user to sign up with automatically become an administrator. More administrators can be added.
